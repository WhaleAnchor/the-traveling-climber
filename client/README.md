USER STORY
As a traveling climber, I want to be able to find indoor and outdoor climbing locations near my current location or a location that I specify, so that I can plan my climbing trips easily. I also want to be able to save my favorite climbing locations, so that I can easily access them later.

To achieve this, the website should allow me to input a location and provide a list of indoor and outdoor climbing locations nearby. I should also be able to filter the list by type of climbing (e.g. bouldering, sport climbing, trad climbing) and difficulty level. Additionally, the website should allow me to add locations to my favorites list and remove them if I no longer wish to save them.
